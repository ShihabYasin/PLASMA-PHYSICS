SIMULATING A SYSTEM OF PLASMA PHYSICS AND BEHAVIOR OF PARTICLES

This work presents the new exact traveling wave solutions of fourth order (1+1)-
dimensional Boussinesq equation. We proposed a new exponential expansion method and 
apply to undertake this study. This study further shows some solitary and periodic waves 
graphically. This paper also shows that the novel exponential expansion method is easily 
applicable and powerful mathematical tool in the symbolic computational approach in the 
field of mathematical physics and engineering. The exact solutions of this equation play a 
vital role for describing different types of wave propagation in any varied natural instances.
